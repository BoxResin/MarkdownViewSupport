## About

This is a lightweight support library for [`MarkdownView`](https://github.com/falnatsheh/MarkdownView). `MarkdownView` is a Markdown renderer for Android. It has backward compatibility with API 7 and higher. For more information, see the [original project](https://github.com/falnatsheh/MarkdownView).

**NOTE**: Some unimportant features of `MarkdownView` have been removed in order to make the library lighter.

## Getting started

To add `MarkdownViewSupport` library to your project, add the following to `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
dependencies { 
    implementation 'boxresin.library:MarkdownViewSupport:2.0.0'
}
```

## Usage

Add `<MarkdownView/>` to your layout: 

```xml
<us.feras.mdv.MarkdownView
    xmlns:mdv="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    mdv:cssFromAssets="markdown_css_themes/paperwhite.css"
    mdv:markdown="## Hello Markdown"
    android:id="@+id/markdownView" />
```
`cssFromAssets` attribute is optional. If you want to apply custom style to the Markdown text, you should make a CSS file at `assets` directory and attach its path to `cssFromAssets` attribute. You can also use `markdownFromAssets` attribute to set Markdown text from the `assets` as well.

and refer it in your Activity/Fragment:

```kotlin
val markdownView = findViewById<MarkdownView>(R.id.markdownView)
```

It's also possible to create the view in code. Do like this in your `onCreate` method:

```kotlin
val markdownView = MarkdownView(this)
setContentView(markdownView)

mainScope.launch {
    markdownView.commit {
        loadMarkdown("## Hello Markdown")
        loadCssFromAssets("markdown_css_themes/paperwhite.css")
    }
}
```

**NOTE**: If you don't want to use Kotlin coroutine, see [1.x version](https://github.com/BoxResin/MarkdownViewSupport/tree/v1.0.0)
